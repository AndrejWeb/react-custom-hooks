# React Custom Hooks

Let me tell you a hint: React custom hooks aren't as complicated as they may seem. They're just like the other React hooks except they have your custom logic. In this repository you can see 2 custom hooks called `useCounter` and `useToggle`. They're used in the components `Counter.jsx` and `Toggle.jsx` respectively. 

To run the project, in project's root directory first run the command:
### `npm install`

and then run this command:

### `npm start`

This runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
